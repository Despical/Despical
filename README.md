### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Hello it's Despical! I'm currently working with Java and C#. I have lots of open-source projects for Java. Here are the some of my recent works **[KOTL](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/king-of-the-ladder.80686/)**, **[OITC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/one-in-the-chamber.81185/)**, **[TNT Run](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tnt-run.83196/)** and [Murder Mystery](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/murder-mystery.109462/). I am also developing other stuff than minigames like command and inventory frameworks for Minecraft, some Music bots for Discord, a video converter made with using JavaFX, Custom Clients and server softwares and, some Unreal Engine 5 stuff. Also you can take a look at the pinned repo's for some of my most recent work.
